This is a completed assembler for SIC.
The code is very not-DRY :(
I wrote it when I was in college.
Had I known better I would have done better (See FUTURE directory for example).
It is complete and errors out for all (most?) error syntaxes.
For details please refer to Leland L. Beck, “System Software – An Introduction to Systems Programming"
